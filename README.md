## Intro

This is a two to four-player turn-based strategy game inspired by the arcade game [Chain Reaction](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chain-reaction-pro-bombs/id993527516).

This game was made using Python and PyGame. It utilizes object-oriented programming and other high school computing techniques.

## Results

We are extremely happy we were able to participate in MasseyHacks III to build this project.

The 24-hour time constraint was easily the hardest but most enjoyable part of this experience.

It was a big challenge to try to build a game this fast, but our team had great planning and teamwork skills throughout this development process to get it done

Although this game did not win any prizes at the hackathon, it was awesome to see our creation come to life - especially after letting the judges and other hackers play against each other!

## Next Steps
Some fun things we would like to build on or explore relating to this project would be:

- Ability for players to play against the computer (at various difficulties)
- Sound effects to various in-game events
- Cleaner split animations
